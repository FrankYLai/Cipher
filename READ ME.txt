version 0.0

concept code for a cipher program.
The scrpt is capable of encoding and decoding ASCII, UTF based files(complex files that use more difficult encoders fail to be detected by the chardet library)

how to use:
0) run the python script main.py
1) Enter the directory of the file you want to encode
2) Enter a password
3) done!

The program will take un source file and encode it into a file in the same directory with the file type .crypt for recognition.
The program automatically detects the type of file and decides to encrypt or decrypt it based on the file extension.
effective for encrypting sensitive information sotored in txt files or in simple programming scripts such as .c .py etc.

This project is still unfinished. changes comming will be imporved file compatibiity, better user interface(.exe file?), and possibly a face unlock.
